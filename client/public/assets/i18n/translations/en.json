  "faq_q1": "What is Crypto Billions?",
  "faq_a1": "<strong>Cryptobillions.io</strong> can be divided into 2 concepts:<br/><br/> first: Is a smart contract or application running on a cryptocurrency network Tron. The application code is programmed to distribute incoming transfersamong participants according to a specific algorithm. <br/><br/> Second: This is the site itself, providing an interface for the convenience of working with a smart contract.\n",
  "faq_q2": "Who is the project administrator?",
  "faq_a2": "<strong>In Cryptobillions there is no administrator. </strong><br/><br/> There is a creator who uploaded the contract code to the cryptocurrency blockchain Tron. Since then, the smart contract has been part of the overall network, which is supported by miners. No one has the right to affect the operation of a smart contract, delete it or stop it. Any attempt to make unauthorized changes will be rejected due to inconsistency with previous copies in the blockchain.\n",
  "faq_q3": "Can a transaction remain in the balance of a smart contract?",
  "faq_a3": "Ruled out. The contract was programmed so as not to accumulate funds, but to serve only as a transmitter. The balance of the contract is always zero, anyone can verify this. It simply lacks the function of taking funds to your balance. Any transaction will reach the desired goal safe and sound.",
  "faq_q4": "What currency does the project work with?",
  "faq_a4": "Since the smart contract is published in the software environment of Tron, then, accordingly, participation in the project is possible only with this digital currency.",
  "faq_q5": "What is needed to participate in the project?",
  "faq_a5": "It is enough to have a computer or smartphone with Tron wallet.",
  "faq_q6": "And if the project collapses, will I lose money?",
  "faq_a6": "Ruled out. The smart contract is absolutely transparent, all data is recorded in the blockchain chain. No scam or fraud. The project cannot fail. It will work as long as the blockchain exists, even if the site is closed.",
  "faq_q7": "How can I be sure that my wallet will not be blocked?",
  "faq_a7": "In the cryptocurrency industry, there is no such thing as wallet blocking. This is impossible and technically impossible even by the creator of cryptocurrency (this is a feature of the technology). Created by you the TRX wallet belongs only to you.",
  "faq_q8": "How to register in the project?",
  "faq_a8": "<strong>To register you must do the payment first.</strong> To do this, go from the main page to \"<a href=\"/register\">Register\"</a> and follow the instructions. After successful payment, you take a place in the structure and are considered a full participant.\n",
  "faq_q9": "Which wallet is better to use?",
  "faq_a9": "There are many suitable wallets. The most important thing is not to use exchange wallets! We recommend using 2 type of wallets, these are: Metamask - if you are working from a personal computer. (Download from the official website)",
  "faq_q10": "Is it possible to earn passively here?",
  "faq_a10": "In addition to personal invitations, partners can appear in your structure in two ways: these are \"Overflows\" and \"Gifts\". Therefore, it can be argued that the system has the possibility of passive earnings. But this does not guarantee you a quick decent income, which other successful participants who are active can boast of.\n",
  "faq_q11": "What are overflows?",
  "faq_a11": "Overflow is a process that occurs when a participant registers in upline or downline, in which the first level is filled with participants. The next new member falls into the structure of this upline below or downline above, in the nearest free place.",
  "faq_q12": "Can I register if I came to the site without an participant link?",
  "faq_a12": "Yes, such members are called \"free participants.\" These are participants who came for any reason WITHOUT an affiliate link. Free participants are distributed evenly across the System (from left to right), starting from those uplines that were previously registered.\n",
  "faq_q13": "How to obtain TRON in my wallet?",
  "faq_a13": "There are many exchangers. Reliable and proven exchangers can be found on the website bestchange. Ru. If this is your first time making an exchange, follow these instructions: <br/><br/> 1) Go to the site bestchange. Ru. <br/><br/> 2) Choose the appropriate payment system with which you want to make an exchange for the desired currency Ethereum. <br/><br/>3) Choose the right service with the best rate. <br/><br/>4) Go to the site of the selected exchanger and follow the simple instructions. The exchange is usually automatic and takes place very quickly.<br/><br/> 5) Make sure that your wallet Tron funds received. Note: When replenishing with bank cards, exchangers may request card verification for the first time. <br/><br/> Typically, this is a photo card on the background of the exchange page. Subsequent replenishment is done instantly. If you donâ€™t want to verify your card in the exchanger, you can first top up your QIWI or YandexMoney account from your bank card (via the interface of either of these two payment systems, and not through the exchanger), and then change from such a payment system through the exchanger to Tron wallet without card verification\n",
  "faq_q14": "What happens if my partner buys a level before me?",
  "faq_a14": "The money will be redirected to your upline of the same line as your partner. If you buy levels on time, this will not happen. If this happened, itâ€™s not scary. If you find this in time, then after activating the level, continue to receive the remaining transfers for this level.\n",
  "faq_q15": "What will happen if you do not extend the level and it is deactivated?",
  "faq_a15": "Your account remains in the System forever, and at any time you can extend the levels and continue to receive income\n",
